# EH6126 - Advanced Clinical Trial Design and Analysis

## Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3, testing

Welcome to EH6126. As part of the module we will provide some data analysis examples delivered through the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/) whilst using the [RStudio GUI](https://rstudio.com/). While most of the content will be demonstrated in the tutorial videos, we will also provide you with an opportunity to perform the analysis yourself, if you wish to dip your toes in warm waters of R.

You have two main options at this point:

1. Download R and RStudio on your own machine
2. Use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) web interface 

Use the introductory video to help make this decision. At the time of writing, the current R release is 4.0.2 ("Taking Off Again").

**Note:** If you already have R installed but need to update it, follow the steps provided in the R_update_presentation.pdf that is located in the `docs` folder. Best to do this via the R GUI, rather than in the RStudio GUI. 

## Once R and RStudio are installed, check that the following works...

**In RStudio, open the testing_testing R-project file (.Rproj)**

+ File
+ Open Project...
+ testing_testing.Rproj

**Next open and run testing_testing.R R script.**

+ File
+ Open File...
+ testing_testing.R

Click on the run button to run each line of code. If your RStudio session window mirrors that in the `successful_test.png` file located in the `plots` folder, GREAT! You're ready to go.
